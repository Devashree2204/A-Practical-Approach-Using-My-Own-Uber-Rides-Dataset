# A-Practical-Approach-Using-My-Own-Uber-Rides-Dataset
Problem Statement -- 
- Lack of visibility on business-main metrics hindering insights and decision-making for managers.
- Need to establish a clear understanding of the purpose and goals of data manipulation and analysis.
- Formulating specific questions to guide the analysis process.
- Questions include trip frequency, completion and cancellation rates, drop-off locations, preferred product types, average fare, distance, amount, and time spent on rides, weekday fare averages, longest/shortest and most/least expensive rides, and average lead time before initiating a trip.
- The questions serve as a guide but do not encompass the entire analysis.
- The need, intention, and pain associated with the lack of visibility on business-main metrics need to be articulated (the "WHAT" question).
- Understanding the purpose and goals behind addressing this problem is crucial (the "WHY" question).
- Determining the appropriate tools and approaches to solve the problem (the "HOW" question).
- Clear comprehension of the problem and purpose is essential before proceeding with further analysis steps.
